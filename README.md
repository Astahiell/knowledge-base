# voxelhost knowledge base
This website was built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/docs/sidebar). It contains all important information on creating own Minecraft server hosted on [voxelhost.pl](https://voxelhost.pl). Currently it's only available in Polish language.

### Installation

```
$ yarn
```

### Local Development

```
$ yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Contributions
Contributions are welcome. We accept most PRs that make sense and are correct gramatically. There are no guidelines 
however try to create texts that are easy to understand for anyone, even newbies (avoid proffesional terminology, explain things in easiest possible way).
If you need any assistance with setting up development environment, we're happy to help on our Discord.
